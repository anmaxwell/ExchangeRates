# ExchangeRates

This is a practise project to get more experience with SVMs and Random Forest while doing more scripting.  

The idea is to try to predict the Â£:$ exchange rate using news headlines and previous rates.  

- Having an automated script to pull down the latest headlines and recent rates
- Convert the headlines to vectors
- Push these to a Postgres DB
- Use these to predict if the rate will increase or decrease using SVMs and if the change will be small, medium or large using Random Forest
- Potential additional work to create a dashboard
